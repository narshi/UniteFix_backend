### 2.7 Incoming Services (Partner) — CRITICAL GAPS

## 3. Features Not in Figma But Needed

### 3.1 Password Reset
```
Forgot Password → Enter Phone/Email → OTP → Verify → New Password → Login
```
**APIs needed:**
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` → Send OTP
- `POST /api/auth/verify-reset-otp` → Return reset token
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` → Update password

### 3.2 Rating & Review System
**Database table needed:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  service_request_id INTEGER REFERENCES service_requests(id),
  from_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  to_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  provider_id INTEGER REFERENCES service_providers(id),
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  review TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
**APIs needed:**
- `POST /api/ratings/service/:serviceId` — Submit rating
- `GET /api/ratings/provider/:providerId` — Provider's ratings
- `GET /api/ratings/provider/:providerId/average` — Average score

### 3.3 Push Notifications

| Service completed | User | "Rate your experience" |
| New assignment | Partner | "New job: {type} at {location}" |
| Payment received | Partner | "₹{amount} credited to wallet" |

**Tables needed:** `deviceTokens`, `notifications`
**Infrastructure:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android) + APNS (iOS)

### 3.4 Profile Picture Upload
**Implementation:** Multipart upload → Cloud storage (S3/Cloudinary) → CDN URL → Save to user record
**APIs needed:**
- `POST /api/client/profile/picture` — Upload

## 6. Technical Notes for App Team

### Location
- Partner GPS updates: `POST /api/serviceman/location/update` — call periodically
- Service start geo-fence: Must be within 500m of service location
- Pincode validation: Only 581xxx (Uttara Kannada) accepted

### Payments
- Razorpay SDK integration required in mobile app
- Flow: Create order (server) → Razorpay checkout (app) → Webhook verifies (server)
- Booking fee: ₹250 on service creation
- ⚠️ Payment routes not yet registered — backend fix needed first

### Images
- `photos[]` field expects URLs, not files
- Need file upload endpoint that returns CDN URLs
- Max 5 photos per service request

### Real-time (Not Available Yet)
- Currently polling-based — app must refresh manually
- WebSocket support not built
- Push notifications not built
- Plan for pull-to-refresh in first version
