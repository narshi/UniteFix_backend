## 4. Business Logic (Implemented & Working)

### 4.1 Booking State Machine ✅
```
CREATED → ASSIGNED → ACCEPTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
   ↓         ↓          ↓            ↓              ↓
CANCELLED CANCELLED  CANCELLED   DISPUTED       DISPUTED
```
- `validateStateTransition()` enforces allowed transitions
- Partner ACCEPT/DENY now implemented
- OTP required for ACCEPTED → IN_PROGRESS
- Payment verification required for IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- Wallet credit on COMPLETED (hold → release after 7 days)
- Inventory deduction on COMPLETED (if items provided)
- Full audit logging on every transition

### 4.2 Rating System ✅ **NEW**
- 1-5 star ratings with optional text review
- One rating per service (unique constraint)
- Average + distribution calculation
- Only completed services can be rated
- Customer can only rate their own services

### 4.3 Wallet V2 ✅ **NOW WITH API**
- Storage layer: credit-on-hold, release, cron batch
- **NEW:** Partner balance API, transaction history, withdrawal (min ₹500)
- Earnings summary: today/week/month/total with rating

### 4.4 Inventory ✅ **NOW WITH ADMIN CRUD**
- Storage layer: deduction with idempotency + stock floor
- **NEW:** Admin list, create, update, restock with audit trail, low-stock alerts

### 4.5 Support Tickets ✅ **NOW WORKING**
- Customer: create, list, view details, reply
- Admin: list with priority sorting, reply, status management
- Email notifications (nodemailer, requires SMTP config)
